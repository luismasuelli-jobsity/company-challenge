A bot will have:

 - Its own requirements.txt file, including:
   - "requests" library.
   - "https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html" this library.
 - Its own python base image (same version of the application dockerfile).
 - The following optional environment variables:
   - FINBOT_USERNAME, by default "finbot".
   - FINBOT_PASSWORD, by default "pa$$w0rd".
   - FINBOT_ROOMS (a colon-separated list of rooms), by default '' which will connect to ALL rooms.
 - What will it do (a single, dockerized, entry-point script):
   - 1. Try to http login and get a token, or fail with log.
   - 2. Try to connect to the server, with its token.
     - Its lifecycle will attend all the commands and, when receiving a custom with command == "stock",
       proceed with the whole logic.
   - 3. All the interaction will be logged to stdout (both incoming and outgoing).
   - 4. The lifecycle will end when the connection is closed.
